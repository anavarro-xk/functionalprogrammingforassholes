# Functional Programming forAssholes(likeMe);
This is a brief course on functional programming.  Very important topic if we want to become good at refactoring code and unit testing.
We will learn here stuff like:
- WTF is functional programming.
- Cool array methods and other high order functions.
- Examples: turning smelly code into great, unit testable code.
