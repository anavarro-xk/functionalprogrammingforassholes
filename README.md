# Functional Programming forAssholes(likeMe);
This is a brief course on functional programming.  Very important topic if we want to become good at refactoring code and unit testing.
We will learn here stuff like:
- WTF is functional programming.
- What is a high order function.
- What is a callback function.
- What is a closure.
- Cool array methods and other high order functions.
- Examples: turning smelly code into great, unit testable code.
- Lots and lots more...

Every topic will have it's own folder.  Each folder will have the following naming convention:
fpjs_chapterNumber_topic.

Inside each folder you will find an article in .md and also some html, css and js files with the examples.

Hope this helps me (or anyone) to become a better javascript developer.
